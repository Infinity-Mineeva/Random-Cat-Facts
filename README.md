Introduction
---


Following my completion of Module 7 of Scrimba's [Frontend Developer Career Path Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), *Working with APIs*, I wanted to further solidify my understanding of the topics covered. So I set about creating this simple App that retrieves random Cat-related facts üê±

Changes
---

Since I'm currently learning the ropes of React, the only change is graphical. I updated the look of the app to give it a more cat-oriented theme.

Methodology
---


Originally, I wanted to make an App for random general facts, but I stumbled on the **Cat Facts API**, and changed course.

I then went into Figma to draw up simple layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop. When completed I wrote up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

<br>

Tools I Used
---


- HTML5
- CSS (Mobile-first design)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Cat Facts API 1.0.0 ](https://catfact.ninja/)

<br>

What I learned
---


I was going through Figma's tutorials at the time, so it was cool to use it for one of my projects! 

Also, it was nice to get my hands dirty with Fetch API.

<br>

Items for further study / Continued development
---

I'm still curious to see how I could refactor the code to work with React, so once I get some more practice in, I'll give it a shot.
